Before submitting an entry for the weekly challenges, please check that you
have done all the following things:

- [ ] My code runs inside the showcase and outside my editor (I've run `python main.py` in a shell)
- [ ] The only modified files are my folder inside the current challenge folder.
- [ ] All the metadata in `metadata.py` is correct, especially the author, requirements and achievements.
- [ ] My code runs on python 3.7, so that as much people as possible can run it, or I have modified the minimum python version in `metadata.py`.
