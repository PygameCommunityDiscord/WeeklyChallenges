Before submitting an entry for the weekly challenges, please check that you
have done all the following things:

- [ ] My code runs inside the showcase and outside of my editor (run `python main.py` in a shell)
- [ ] The only modified files are my folder inside of the current challenge folder.
- [ ] Every external module that I use is listed in my `requirements.txt`.
- [ ] The variables `__author__` and `__achievements__` in my code are set correctly.
- [ ] My code runs on python 3.7+, so that as much people as possible can run it.
